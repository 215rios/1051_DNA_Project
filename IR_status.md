Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### So far, I've completed two out of three minigmaes that we initially planed to do. We also have our homescreen set up with working buttons and the rough draft for our story. 

TODO

#### We're missing one of our minigames that we initially wanted to implement, which isn't too hard to acomplish. It's more like, I'm still figuring out what kind of minigame we should use and how to relate it to the central dogma for DNA. We're still working on our other game scenes and fleshing out our story for the player to follow along with. We planned to possibly record some sound effects or implement free videogame audio to add some flavor to the experience. We also are trying to figure out a way that's cohesive o compile all of our work together.

TODO

#### My partner had some minor hiccups with the game's buttons, but I don't think that'll put us behind or anything. We're on the verge of figuring that out and fixing any small bugs we may have had.
